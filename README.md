# Scenario Description
The goal of this project is to model and implement a relational database system to help manage essential operational data for Delta airlines. The system mostly branches off from the main entity, trip, that connects information about airports, flights, tickets, baggage, passengers, and more through their relationships. This model is used to help centralize and organize key operational data improving efficiency in areas such as flight management, customer service, baggage handling, and employee assignments. The project includes queries to help produce and analyze data that can be used to enhance the overall experience for both the staff and passengers at Delta Airlines.

# Data Model
Our model works to connect entities within Delta in order to allow managers to filter information regarding customers, employees, flights, specific trips, airports, baggage, Delta accounts, and much more. 

The main center of the data model is the trip entity. The model has the following relationships: 

 The trip entity has a one-to-many identifying relationship with the ticket entity. A ticket can consist of many trips while a specific trip belongs to one specific ticket. This relationship allows managers to filter the tickets that are being bought most or least often. The relationship is identifying because a trip requires the ticket number to be uniquely defined.
 
The trip entity also has a one-to-many non-identifying relationship to the baggage entity. A specific trip can be associated with multiple bags while a specific bag can only be associated with one specific trip. This allows managers to filter data regarding baggage weight, type, etc for each individual trip. The relationship is non-identifying because baggage and trip can exist independently.

The trip entity also has two one-to-many relationships with the airport entity. One for departing airports, and one for arriving airports. An arriving airport can have many different trips, but a trip can only have one arriving airport. The same is true for a departing airport. These relationships help analyze popular flight routes without needing the airport keys for trip identification.

The trip entity has a one-to-many relationship with the passenger entity. A passenger can book multiple trips, but one specific trip is associated with one specific passenger. This relationship is non-identifying because a trip doesn’t need the passenger’s key for identification.

The passenger entity has a one-to-one relationship with the Delta Account entity. A passenger only has one Delta Account and a specific Delta Account can only be related to one customer. This is non-identifying because some customers may not have a Delta Account and it is therefore not necessary to define a specific passenger. 
The ticket entity has a one-to-many relationship with the flight entity. A flight can have many tickets associated with it, however, a specific ticket only links to a specific flight. This relationship is non-identifying because a flight is not necessary to define a ticket. 

The flight entity has a one-to-many relationship to the airplane entity. An airplane can have many different flights that it is used for, while a flight only uses one specific airplane. This relationship is non-identifying, because an airplane is not identified by its flight. 

The flight entity also has a one-to-many relationship with the flight crew entity. A flight crew can go on multiple flights but a flight only has one specific flight crew. This relationship is non-identifying because a flight is not identified by the flight crew that is on it. 

The flight crew entity has a many-to-many relationship with the employee entity. A flight crew can have multiple employees and an employee can work on many different flight crews. This relationship is identifying because you need to know both the employee and the flight crew they were working on to identify an employee on a flight crew. The weak entity of this many to many relationship, flight_crew_employee, is used to help connect the relationships. This entity helps identify the flight crew for a specific flight and what each of the employee’s specific roles were.

# Queries

<img width="707" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 4 11 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4490e5d3-a8e9-4e23-8ece-3e4f63cef199">

## Complex Queries (6)
1. Display the New York passengers who's trips on average are lower than other passengers' average miles from New York.

<img width="677" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 4 14 14 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffacba3d-eb62-48de-b52b-781e91cc802a">

Identifying New York passengers with trips that have lower average mileage than other passengers' average mileage from New York helps management identify customers that Delta needs to entice more to go on more trips to increase revenue. Delta's team could use these identified customers in New York to study and get the marketing team, advertising team, customer service team, and more to work on different strategies to target these people to go on more trips with Delta.


2. Identify the flight crew members who have worked the most hours and more than the average hours of a flight crew. 


<img width="630" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 4 22 26 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58fbbc36-846b-4a46-b70e-a557f82bfcaf">


Displaying flight crew members with the most hours that are more than the average hours of a flight crew will help managers distribute workload evenly and prevent overworking employees. Bringing attention to these flight crew employees that are working many hours allows management to analyze these employees and their hours. If there are employees working too many hours, management will be able to see that from the results of this query and will adjust the schedules accordingly.

3. Identify passengers who have flown the most miles and have more than 5000 miles but have not signed up for a Delta account.


<img width="677" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 4 29 09 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83bf3d5d-2e2a-468f-b7fd-2a23f0573051">


Identifying passengers who have flown many miles but do not have a Delta account will help management figure out what passengers to target for a loyalty program. Enticing these high-value passengers to join a loyalty program could help increase retention as well as improve customer experience for those who are frequent fliers.

4. Determine which 10 routes (from departing airport to arriving airport) generate the most revenue.


<img width="476" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 4 34 57 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5b53aa3-8368-4796-b31c-176eee2b0e65">


Determining which routes generate the most revenue will be helpful for management because these high-revenue routes could be prioritized to continue to increase Delta's revenue. Delta can achieve this by adding more flights to these routes, allocate more resources to these flights, and adjust the pricing to these flights.


5. Analyze which class of seating is the most popular among frequent flyers (Delta Account members who have over 50,000 miles).

   
<img width="684" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 4 42 59 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62418236-9017-47e6-a82f-549b041e0f8c">

Identifying the most popular class seating fo the most frequent flyers will help management understand these high-value customers' preferences. This information can be used to adjust the availability of the seats in each class accordingly. This allows for there to be the proper amount of seating to be available in each class to have room for the more profitable customers.

6. Show the captains with the most experience (longest amount of time at delta) who have worked at Delta for at least 10 years and display their total hours and miles they have spent flying for this given time period.


<img width="681" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 4 52 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57823f10-16a0-4650-9feb-ae61ae13ce09">


Identifying the more experienced captains can help management improve operational excellence in a few ways. For example, these captians can be helpful with mentoring and training. Management can identify which captains to schedule to mentor other less expereinced pilots to help with safety and efficiency. Delta may also schedule these captains to be on more difficult and critical routes. This can also help management plan for retirements and create a smoother process with hiring.


## Simple Queries (4)

7. Display the passengers who have the most miles and where they are from (city and state).


<img width="545" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 5 02 27 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaa4e17f-d2aa-411b-b71d-ec3cbc3ce405">

This information will tell Delta which regions and states they should focus their marketing towards as these areas are where their most frequent flyers are located. In turn, knowing this information can also give Delta an idea about areas they should make sure they are providing the best quality services and flights to their most loyal customers.

8. Display the number of times a flight as arrived at each airport.

   
<img width="578" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 5 03 01 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62468af3-33ce-4e87-8b22-a4048b17dad5">

This will tell Delta where their planes fly to the most and give an idea of the locations where they should focus their services and quality of their lounges on. 

9. Display the airplane brand that is used the most at Delta.


<img width="680" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 5 03 48 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fe22aa1-31ca-4167-aace-40254585ecec">


This can show delta which plane brands are most optimal for flying and who are major suppliers are. Knowing this information can allow delta to know which clients to prioritize and who they are most loyal to. 


10. Display the average amount of bags that are brought by each passenger when traveling to different locations.

    
<img width="692" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 5 04 26 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2d6cc0f-7538-43e4-876c-f4edcb2d336e">


This can show Delta around how many bags they are going to have when they are traveling to a certain destination. In turn, they have a predetermined estimate of about how much extra weight is going to be on certain flights so they can plan accordingly.
